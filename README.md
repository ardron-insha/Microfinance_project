| Problem                                    | Solution                                        |

| Not enough data points. Once we remove people above the second lowest quintile, we’re left with approximately 900. records which is not enough for the analysis we would like to do.      | No solution to this. We can recognise the limitations of our analysis and ensure that the results are heavily caveated to take this into account.  |
| Not known whether people accessing financial services are doing so from a microfinance institution.| Examine literature in this field to assess whether there is any information collected so far on average income of account owner for MFI to deduce which income quintile they would fall under. We could use Mix Market data to predict this. |
| We only have snapshot data of someone’s banking journey, we cannot see how they might have been impacted by the introduction of microfinance services in their city/village. | No solution for this. We don’t have panel data which follows an individual through their life. However, we could use the 2017 data to see how banking journeys in aggregate have changed.|
