Limitations

  Problem 1: Not enough data points. Once we remove  people above the second lowest quintile, 
  we’re left with approximately 900  records which is not enough for the analysis we would like to do.  
  
  How we can overcome it: No solution to this. We can recognise  the limitations of our 
  analysis and ensure that the results are heavily  caveated to take this into account.  
  
  
  Problem 2: Not known whether people accessing financial services are doing so from a microfinance institution.
  
  How we can overcome it: Examine literature in this field to assess whether there is any information collected so far on average income of
  account owner for MFI to deduce which income quintile they would fall under. We could use Mix Market data to predict this.
  
  
  Problem 3: We only have snapshot data of someone’s banking journey, we cannot see how they might have been impacted by the
  introduction of microfinance services in their city/village.
  
  How we can overcome it: No solution for this. We don’t have panel data which follows an individual through their life. However, we could
  use the 2017 data to see how banking journeys in aggregate have changed.
